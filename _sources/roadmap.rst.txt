Roadmap
=======

Edgetest is a lightweight and stable codebase with the majority of development coming from
novel plugins. As the developer team, we plan on responding to feature requests and bug
fixes from the community as they arise.

The major long term initiative that we want to explore is the ability to run this library
against non-Python codebases. This feature would significantly expand the utility of ``edgetest``,
but we have not allocated any resources to it at this time.
